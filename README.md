# Sample Web App

This sample web app is based on the default starter code for an ASP.NET MVC project. The main page displays a revolving carousel. In the exercises, you'll build a Docker image from this web app and deploy it to the App Service. You'll add a webhook to the web app. You'll then add another page to the carousel and commit the source code. The webhook will cause the App Service to deploy the new version of the web app.

This app requires the .NET Core runtime.
